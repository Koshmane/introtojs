  Differentiate between Statically typed and Dynamically typed 
  programming languages and give examples of languages that fall under each category.


  A programming language is statically typed if the type of a variable is known at compile time. 
For some languages this means that programmer must specify what type each variable is; 
other languages offer some form of type inference, 
the capability of the type system to deduce the type of a variable (e.g.: OCaml, Haskell, Scala, Kotlin).

The main advantage here is that all kinds of checking can be done by the compiler, 
and therefore a lot of trivial bugs are caught at a very early stage.

Examples: C, C++, Java, Rust, Go, Scala

A programming language is dynamically typed if it is associated with run-time values, 
and not named variables/fields/etc. 
This means that you as a programmer can write a little quicker because you do not have to specify
 types every time.

Examples: Perl, Ruby, Python, PHP, JavaScript, Erlang



Differentiate between the JavaScript data types null and undefined.

Null: It is the intentional absence of the value. It is one of the primitive values of JavaScript. while,
Undefined: It means the value does not exist in the compiler.
